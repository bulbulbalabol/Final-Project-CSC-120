# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 We broke the project into parts. We created an outline, and from there we determined what order to tackle the steps. We started by creating a bare shell of the game, and adding in things from there. At first we just needed to create 9 different locations, with three options in each. Then we needed to let the user choose a location and chose an option. Then we added in the treasure, the sword, and the question "would you like to see the map?"
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 We learned a lot about GUI and how to display images. We learned learned about the term .isEmpty(). We also learned about using a hashSet to store Strings.
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 We really wanted to create a game window for the user to type into, rather than them having type into the terminal. However we would have had to rewrite the game to have it played entirely inside of a pop up window, and if we had known that from the beginning, it may have been doable. But since we were so far along already, we decided it wasn't worth it.
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
 We really wanted to are our game as visual as possible. We were successful in using GUI for the pop up map and treausre gif, but we wanted to create visuals throughout the game. If we had more time, we wanted to create a game window and also dipictions of the player moving around the map. We even *briefly* discussed adding sound effects!
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
 JJ (from class) was the one who gave us the idea to use visuals in the firs place, very on in the project! She also suggested we include some sort of sound effects, though we never got around to that. Also, Michelle (from class) gave us the idea to create one location class, and then create 9 different instances of location. This was also toward the begining of the project, but it saved us a lot of time in the end because if we had created different classes for each location, it would have made our lives a LOT harder.
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
 We would recommend simplifying the architecture diagram. We feel like we started our with a lot of classes, but in the end were able to merge some of them, or remove others completely. We think our origional architecture diagram was a bit bold, and we are glad we were able to combine several of the classes for simplification purposes.
 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
 We were very forunate to have worked with each other because we were friends at the begining of this project, and we only grew closer throughout the project. We worked together well, and communication was clear and easy. We all had different strengths that we played to and utilized, and that made the project much more managable and enjoyable.
